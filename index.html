          <h1>Hey, my name is Apollo Uitto!</h1>
          <p>
            I am a 20 year old aspiring programmer from Helsinki, Finland.
            My main focus of programming centers around web development
            and video games. I also like to do other projects, such as
            programs about calculating and generating. My main programming
            languages used are HTML, CSS, Javascript and C#. As for the
            use of AI, I occasionally use it to speed up the process, but
            I always carefully examine the code to test it indeed works
            as intended.

              <p>
                For the longest time, I have had the dream of creating a
                game. In 2022, I finally decided to take real steps
                towards the goal as I began learning Unity and the
                code it operatres on, C#. After complications with the
                company back in 2023, I decided to move on to Godot,
                which also supported C#, the language I had grown fond
                of. Since then, I have been learning and experimenting
                inside Godot, creating many different kinds of games,
                some bigger, some smaller, though none yet released.
                Through all of my ideas, I have settled on two
                projects, which are my current focuses and the games
                I truly plan on one day publishing.

                I initially learned web development around the time
                I started coding in Unity, after taking a class where
                we created a webgame. Since then, I have worked on
                several websites, including business, tournament and
                personal blog sites. I have not yet published a website
                of my own as there have been no need, but I have
                been thinking of starting a blog for my game development,
                in which I would like to put my web dev skills to the
                absolute test with all the cool features I can think of.

              <p>
                This is not limited to programming, although very much
                connected to it. I tend to get a lot of different ideas
                and solutions for problems, in all areas of life.
                Whether it's creative programming, level design or
                story telling, I like to "overthink" things and come up
                with many different approaches, then choosing the best
                one.
              </p>
              <p>
                I always approach my work with efficiency and flexibility
                in mind. For example, I want my code to be as general as
                reasonably possible. Also, I want it to be as simple and
                lightweight as possible.
